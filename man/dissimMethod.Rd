\usage{
dissimMethod(methods, k, distancemethod, n, what = c("tags", "matrix"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{methods}{a vector of character representing method
  names in caret}

  \item{k}{the number of clusters}

  \item{distancemethod}{the method used to calculate the
  dissimilarity}

  \item{n}{number methods to sample per cluster}

  \item{what}{what to return, either "tags" for the
  caretTags data or "matrix" for the dissimilarity matrix}
}
\value{
Returns either a dataframe or a matrix with the
dissimilarity values for the methods sampled and the names
of the methods.
}
\description{
Create a subset of caret methods in an effort to maximize
dissimilarity between them along the features identified in
the caretTags dataset
}
